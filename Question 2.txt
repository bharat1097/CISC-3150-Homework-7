Question: What is the correct behavior of static and transient variables in the context of serialization?

Static: Static variables are implicitly transient, so you don't need to declare them as such. Serialization is for serializing instances, not classes. Static fields (methods are irrelevant since they are part of the class definition so they aren't serialized) will be reinitialized to whatever value they are set to when the class is loaded. Which makes them essentially serializable (although it's not a good practice).
	

Transient: Transient variable are ignored during the serialization process. When deserializing, the variable get the default values for their corresponding types.
